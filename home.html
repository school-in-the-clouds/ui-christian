            <p>We'll put a happy little bush here. Let your imagination be your guide. 
                It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. 
                You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. 
                Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. 
                Let that brush dance around there and play.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>You need the dark in order to show the light. I'm sort of a softy, 
                I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Have fun with it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. 
                This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.
                <br>
                <br>
                Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? 
                That's your challenge for the day. Let's make a happy little mountain now.
                <br>
                <br>
                Working it up and down, back and forth. 
                You're meant to have fun in life. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. 
                If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. 
                When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Just relax and let it flow. 
                That easy. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. What the devil.
                <br>
                <br>
                We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, 
                come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. 
                It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Just use the old one inch brush. 
                Let's do it again then, what the heck. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. 
                You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.

            <p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. 
                Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. 
                Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. 
                You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - 
                or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.
