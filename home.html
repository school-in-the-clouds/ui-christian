            <p>We'll put a happy little bush here. Let your imagination be your guide. 
                It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. 
                You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. 
                Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. 
                Let that brush dance around there and play.

            <p>You need the dark in order to show the light. I'm sort of a softy, 
                I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Have fun with it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. 
                This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.

            <p>Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here.

                so we'll give him a little friend. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. 
                It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.

            <p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. 
                Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. 
                Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. 
                You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - 
                or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.
